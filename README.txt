# 1. Installation
Bowtie (http://bowtieapp.com/) and iTunes must be installed.

Bowtie shows information of the song playing in iTunes on your Desktop (with many cool themes) and control iTunes and starring your songs. Also submits your songs to last.fm

Copy BowTunes.app to your Applications folder.

# 2. Use
On launching BowTunes iTunes will open silently. And will start to play. Next Bowtie will open.

You had to open this two apps one by one. With this script you can open both just with one app.
